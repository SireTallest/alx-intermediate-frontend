# ✅ Steps I Took to Install Sass

1. **I opened my terminal**
   Since I’m on Linux, I used the default **Terminal**. (On Windows, I would have used Command Prompt or PowerShell).

---

2. **I installed Sass globally** so I can use it in any project:

   ```bash
   npm install -g sass
   ```

---

3. **I confirmed the installation** by checking the version:

   ```bash
   sass --version
   ```

   The terminal displayed a version number like:

   ```
   1.77.6 compiled with dart2js
   ```

   That confirmed Sass was successfully installed on my system.

4. **(Optional step I could take in future projects):**
   If I only want Sass installed inside one project folder, I would run:

   ```bash
   npm install sass --save-dev
   ```

   and then check it with:

   ```bash
   npx sass --version
   ```

⚠️ **Note to Myself:**

* `sass` is the official and updated package (Dart Sass).
* The old `node-sass` package is outdated and should only be used if I’m working on an old codebase.
